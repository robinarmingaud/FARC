"        This pandemic clearly raised increased awareness on airborne "

"        Out of the main modes of viral transmission, the airborne route "
"of SARS-CoV-2 seems to have a significant importance to the spread of "
"COVID-19 infections world-wide, hence proper guidance to building "
"engineers or facility managers, on how to prevent on-site transmission, "
