"        Currently, the existing public health measures point to the "
"importance of proper building and environmental engineering control "
"measures, such as proper Indoor Air Quality (IAQ).\n"
"        This pandemic clearly raised increased awareness on airborne "
"transmission of respiratory viruses in indoor settings.\n"
"        Out of the main modes of viral transmission, the airborne route "
"of SARS-CoV-2 seems to have a significant importance to the spread of "
"COVID-19 infections world-wide, hence proper guidance to building "
"engineers or facility managers, on how to prevent on-site transmission, "
"is essential.\n"

" FARC stands for Flow-R Airborne Risk Calculator and was developed to "
"better understand and quantify the risk of long-range airborne spread "
"viruses in workplaces. FARC comes with different applications that allow "
"more or less flexibility in the input parameters: "

"    The mathematical and physical model simulate the long-range airborne "
"spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus in a finite volume, assuming a homogenous "
"mixture, and estimates the risk of COVID-19 airborne transmission "
"therein. The results DO NOT include (for now) short-range airborne "
"exposure (where the physical distance plays a factor) nor the other known"
" modes of SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Hence, the output from this model is "
"only valid when the other recommended public health & safety instructions"

"The model used is based on scientific publications relating to airborne "

"science. It can be used to compare the effectiveness of different "
"airborne-related risk mitigation measures.\n"
"The tool helps assess the potential dose of infectious airborne viruses "
"in indoor gatherings, with people seated, standing, moving around, while "
"breathing, speaking or shouting/singing. The model is based on the "
"exponential dose-response of disease transmission, which assumes a fixed "
"value for the average infectious dose.\n"
